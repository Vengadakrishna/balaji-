    Please follow these detailed instructions to extract the required information:
    1. Carefully read through the entire document text, paying attention to context and nuances.
    2. For each field listed above, search for relevant information in the document, ensuring no field is overlooked.
    3. Extract the exact text that corresponds to each field.
    4. If a field's information is not found, mark it as "Not found". If the information is unclear, mark it as "Unclear".
    5. Pay close attention to formatting, as some fields may have specific formats (e.g., phone numbers, email addresses).
    6. If a field is mentioned in multiple places, ensure you capture all relevant instances.
    7. If there are any abbreviations or acronyms, provide their full form where applicable.

    Guidelines for handling missing or unclear information:
    - If a date is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from context, extract it and note "Inferred" in parentheses after the date.
    - For numeric fields (e.g., loan amounts), extract the full number including cents if available.
    - For names, extract full names as they appear in the document.
    - If a field has multiple relevant entries, include all of them separated by semicolons.

    After extracting all fields, please present the response in the following format:
    [
        {{ "field_name": "extracted_value" }},
        {{ "field_name": "extracted_value" }},
        ...
    ]
